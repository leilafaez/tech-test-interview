## Task
## focus on creating React components and fetching data which will inherently require state management. If you complete the main goals, searching and filtering will be stretch goals to attempt.

 
## Star Wars character display

## Please use the Star Wars API to fetch data about characters using the https://swapi.dev/people endpoint. Visit the website and interact with the API at https://swapi.dev/ to see what data it returns.

## Create character cards that display the basic information for each character: name, height, birth_year, gender and their swapi url. The cards can be as simple or complex in design as you like (our foucs is on creating components and Javascript knowledge, not CSS and HTML)

## Clicking the character’s url on the card should open a new browser tab or window that takes the user to the character’s page on swapi. For example, when a user clicks Luke Skywalker’s card, they should be taken to https://swapi.dev/people/1

## Stretch goal: Clicking on anywhere else on the card should open a modal – that modal should display the titles of all the films the character has been in
